# Spring-Boot-Project
The objective of your project is to manage a student database using PostgreSQL as the underlying database management system. 
This entails creating a backend application that handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for student records. 
The Spring Boot framework will assist in setting up the application's structure, managing dependencies, and handling various aspects of the web development process.
